I got tired of writing code that I use a lot when working with Novell's cSharp LDAP libraries that interact with eDirectory.  This library is supposed to save development and discovery time by providing methods for some of the most common object types and addtributes that eDirectory provides to us via LDAP.  The library provides classes for user, group, container, ZENworks Desktop Management application objects and probably more things too. The library handles all the LDAPConnection needs and such.
